<h2>What is Minetest?</h2>

<h2>Why Minetest?</h2>
So we can say Minetest is also a cross platform game engine and game. Is not it attractive?

Let's Continue. In this post i want to talk about Minetest game(not game engine and game making). Minetest is a [Sandbox game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game) like Minecraft. but its better and free!

You can make your favorite House, upgrade your tools and survive. you can make your desired minetest! how? with modes. Minetest game a free database for mods. Installing mods in Minetest is easier than you think. 

Minetest is very Lightweight. It's just about 30 or 40 MG! i was a Minecraft player in the past but when i met Minetest, i left Minecraft. 
Minetest have many online and free servers! so you can easily play Minetest with your friends.
