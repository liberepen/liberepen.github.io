Hi guys and welcome to Liberepen. in this post i want to do some plans for our new year. so, let know somthing about new Persian year. It's called Nowruz, an ancient celebration in Iran. it is for about 4360 years ago! you can know more about nowruz in [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz).

<h2>Why planning is important?</h2>

why planning for every year is important? my answer is:"because we need goal!". The human need goal for living and beeing better in the future. if you don't have any goal, you don't know you must to try for what. you will just eat and sleep. come on! we are human!

<h3>My planning for new year</h3>

i want to learn a new language in this year. yes! good guessing, German language. i learn to A2 in last year and i want to go to learn B1 in this year. hmmmmm, not bad :). I want to buy a new computer. not an expencive computer but i want to change this. maby i will buy a laptop.
